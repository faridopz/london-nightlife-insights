    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "During my time working closely with The Jazz Cafe, I noticed that every team meeting revolved around one key question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Who is our audience, and how can we enhance their experience?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This inspired me to explore how data can help venues better understand their crowd — who attends, how they attend (solo or in groups), and how their behavior varies across age and gender. I generated synthetic data using ChatGPT to simulate real London nightlife patterns, venues, and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I extract key insights about ticket behavior and demographics that venues can use to improve programming, marketing, and customer experience strategies.\n",

    "Ticket purchasing behavior is relatively consistent across age and gender groups, averaging just over 2.5 tickets per transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Why it matters:**  \n",
    "This suggests that group size during bookings is stable. It supports the idea that ticket bundle strategies can be applied broadly, without complex segmentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Personalize marketing by genre preferences and age\n",
    "- Understand solo vs. group attendance patterns\n",
    "- Offer targeted incentives (e.g., group drink offers or bring-a-friend deals)\n",
    "- Optimize event lineups for core age segments\n",
